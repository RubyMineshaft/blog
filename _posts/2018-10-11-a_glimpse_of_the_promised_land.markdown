I have been searching for my path my entire life.  It's almost as though I was an Israelite wandering around in the wilderness, except there had been no free manna from heaven.  We all go through this stage in our lives, trying to figure out what exactly it is that we want to do. For some, this process takes longer than others.  I guess I belong to the group who just happens to get lost in the wilderness along the way. 

That's okay, though.  I've had some amazing experiences while wandering in the wilderness. I got to try my hand at many different types of occupations, some enjoyable, some not. I moved to a foreign country, where I lived for five years and met some amazing people, including my partner!  I returned to the US and got married.  And now, here I am in Chicago, and I've finally found my way out of the wilderness.

Throughout my life, there has been one common theme that seems to pop up: technology.  I remember very clearly the first time I used a PC. I was in the first grade, and I was waiting for my mom to come to pick me up from school because I had a fever.  The teacher in the classroom I was waiting in asked a student to show me how to play a computer game.  It was magical.  Actually, it wasn't, it was just some educational game, but to me, it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. Although I may not remember what that particular game was about, I do remember how embarrassed I felt that this boy a grade younger than me knew how to use the computer and I didn't. That was the beginning of my obsession with technology.

While working on a group project in the 9th grade, I decided to learn HTML and make a website for our mock company.  Thinking back on it now, the website was absolutely terrible, but surprisingly passable as far as websites in 2002 go.  My teacher and classmates seemed to be impressed anyway. 

I have always been the person that people come to when they need help with a computer issue. Because of this, I decided a few months ago to take Google's IT Support Professional course through Coursera.  The course was fairly easy for me, and I finished it in about two weeks.  There was one section of the course that focused on operating systems and using PowerShell and Bash. I really enjoyed learning to use the command line, and it was like something clicked for me.  Writing commands for a computer to execute is what programmers do; if I enjoy this, I should try my hand at learning to code!

This brings me to Flatiron School.  I went through the boot camp prep course on learn.co and found that I really loved it. It was an amazing feeling.  I realized that this is the thing I'd been looking for my entire life.  This was my path. 

While I may not have wandered around in the wilderness for a full 40 years, I'd say 30 is darn near close enough!  Now that I've finally seen the Promised Land, nothing is going to hold me back!
