A couple of months ago, we had an unexpected medical diagnosis in my family. I won't go into details, but it was very jarring for us. Because of this, I thought it was best for me to take some time off from my Flatiron studies for both mental and financial reasons. 

At this time, things have more or less leveled out. Even though I've continued to read  and watch videos about Ruby and Rails, picking up where I left off after two months out of the program is going to be somewhat difficult, but it's nothing I can't handle. 

I'm really excited to get back to it. I've really missed learning about rails and all the exciting things it can do!
